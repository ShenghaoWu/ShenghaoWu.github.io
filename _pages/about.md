[Update Dec 2023] I recently joined Tiktok (Bytedance) as a research scientist working on AI for Science.

I graduated with a joint Ph.D. between the [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/) ðŸ§   and the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) from CMU. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/index.html), Prof. [Matthew Smith](https://smithlab.net/), and Prof. [Brent Doiron](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu/). My main research topic is machine learning algorithms for optimizing spiking network models to generate realistic neuronal activity. I have also worked with Prof. [Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/publications.html) and Prof. [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) on individual identification and privacy in brain recordings, and Prof. [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu/home?authuser=0) on generative models and causal inference. 

Before coming to CMU, I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics from Columbia University, where I worked with Prof. [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) on a  [machine learning pipeline](https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass)  for neural signal processing. I have also spent two wonderful years in Hong Kong, where I studied computing mathematics at City University of Hong Kong, before enrolling in the  [joint bachelor's degree program](https://cityu-hk.gs.columbia.edu/) between CityU and Columbia.

Research Interests
=======
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and science. I work closely with experimentalists and develop machine learning algorithms (e.g. generative models, Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning) with applications in neuroscience (e.g. brain circuit modeling), health care (e.g. longitudinal causal inference), and scientific computing (e.g. molecule graph partition).
