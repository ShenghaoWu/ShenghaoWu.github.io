I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the joint program between the [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/) and the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by professor [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/index.html), professor [Matthew Smith](https://smithlab.net/), and professor [Brent Doiron](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu/). My main research topic is machine learning algorithms for optimizing spiking network models to reproduce experimental recordings. I am also fortunate to have worked with professor [Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/publications.html) and professor [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) on individual identification and privacy in brain recordings, and professor [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu/home?authuser=0)  on generative models and causal inference. Before coming to CMU, I obtained a Bacholor's degree in mathematics and statistics from Columbia University, where I worked with professor [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) on a scalable deep learning framework for neural signal processing. I have also spent two wonderful years in Hong Kong, where I studied computing mathematics at City University of Hong Kong, before enrolling in the  [joint bachelor's Degree program](https://cityu-hk.gs.columbia.edu/) between CityU and Columbia.

Research Interests
=======
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. I work closely with experimentalists and develop machine learning tools to study the neuronal mechanisms of brain function. I have developed statistical and machine learning methods using generative models, spiking neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning. Besides neuroscience, I have also worked on projects with applications in health care and scientific computing.
