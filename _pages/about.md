I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the joint program between the [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/) 🧠  and the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/index.html), Prof. [Matthew Smith](https://smithlab.net/), and Prof. [Brent Doiron](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu/). My main research topic is machine learning algorithms for optimizing spiking network models to generate realistic neuronal activity. I have also worked with Prof. [Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/publications.html) and Prof. [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) on individual identification and privacy in brain recordings, and Prof. [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu/home?authuser=0) on generative models and causal inference. 

Before coming to CMU, I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics from Columbia University, where I worked with Prof. [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) on a  [machine learning pipeline](https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass)  for neural signal processing. I have also spent two wonderful years in Hong Kong, where I studied computing mathematics at City University of Hong Kong, before enrolling in the  [joint bachelor's degree program](https://cityu-hk.gs.columbia.edu/) between CityU and Columbia.

Research Interests
=======
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. I work closely with experimentalists and develop machine learning tools to study the neuronal mechanisms of brain function. I have developed statistical and machine learning methods using generative models, spiking neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning. Besides neuroscience, I have also worked on projects with applications in health care and scientific computing.
