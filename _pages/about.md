[Update Jan 2025] I recently joined Amazon AGI as an applied scientist to work on post-training of Nova, Amazon's multi-modal foundation model.

I graduated with a joint Ph.D. between the [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/) 🧠  and the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) from CMU. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/index.html), Prof. [Matthew Smith](https://smithlab.net/), and Prof. [Brent Doiron](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu/). I have been working on machine learning algorithms to automate and accelerate scientific discovery and decision-making processes. I have also worked with Prof. [Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/publications.html) and Prof. [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) on individual identification and privacy in brain recordings, and Prof. [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu/home?authuser=0) on generative models and causal inference. 

Before coming to CMU, I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics from Columbia University, where I worked with Prof. [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) on a  [machine learning pipeline](https://github.com/paninski-lab/yass)  for neural signal processing. I have also spent two wonderful years in Hong Kong, where I studied computing mathematics at City University of Hong Kong, before enrolling in the  [joint bachelor's degree program](https://cityu-hk.gs.columbia.edu/) between CityU and Columbia.

Research Interests
=======
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and science. I work closely with experimentalists and develop ML algorithms (e.g. generative models, Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, causal inference) with applications in neuroscience (e.g. brain circuit modeling), health care (e.g. generative decision making), and scientific computing (e.g. molecule graph partition).
